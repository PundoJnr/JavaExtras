    1.Checked 
    2. unchecked
    
    difference is that the checked exceptions are checked while compiled and the unchecked are checked at runtime.
    
    an example of a checked exception is the thread.sleep() that throws an interruptedException.
    the other exceptions that are cheked at runtime such as divide by zero are unchecked.
